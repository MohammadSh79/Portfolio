                    <p class="margin-bottom-24px">Hi, I'm Mohammad Javad Shams Nejati, living in Lahijan,
                        Guilan, Iran. Born on 4th January 2001. Computers and technology have always fascinated me, and
                        this led me to choose computer engineering as my field of study. Over the past two years, my
                        passion for Machine Learning, particularly in the realm of Computer Vision, has grown immensely.
                        Driven by my enthusiasm, I have taken the initiative to self-learn machine learning, investing
                        extensive time and effort to advance my skills, and do research in this domain.</p>

            <h1 class="heading-2">Experiences</h1>
            <div class="text-block">During my time as a teaching assistant, I had the privilege of supporting multiple
                courses in the University of Guilan. These courses included Microprocessors and Assembly Language,
                Principle of Computer and Programming, Advanced Programming, and Data Structures. As a teaching
                assistant, I helped students, and graded assignments and exams. This experience not only improved my
                ability to effectively communicate complex concepts, but also reinforced my passion for imparting
                knowledge and fostering academic growth.<br><br>Parallel to my teaching assistant role, I entered the world of research. One notable project of mine is "<a
                    href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/17dZEWjvQBBLwdCJbTJFhv1hIWBMPl59p/view?usp=sharing"

                        Detection in Limited Data Settings</strong></a>" a research paper that is currently being
                reviewed for publication. This study explores the application of knowledge distillation techniques to
                tackle the challenge of detecting sperm anomalies in scenarios where the available data is
                scarce. By distilling knowledge from a pre-trained model to a smaller student model, we aimed to achieve
                accurate anomaly detection even with limited data. The research involved analyzing various algorithms,
                conducting experiments, and evaluating the results. This project not only allowed me to contribute to
                the scientific community but also deepened my understanding of machine learning and its potential
                applications in healthcare.</div>
